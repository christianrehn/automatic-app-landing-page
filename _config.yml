app_description                           : With this app you can record and evaluate your training times. To do this, you only have to record the training duration per category (course, driver, wood, iron, ...) and you can then get an overview of your training in the form of a line diagram per month or a pivot table per year and month. It is also possible to define training tasks with a time period and scope. As part of the time recording for each category, you can then also specify whether and to what extent you have worked on a task. The task overview also gives you the opportunity to see to what extent your tasks have already been completed. All data is saved locally in the app and can be exported as well as imported in JSON format. This makes it possible, for example, to convert the recorded and exported training data from JSON to CSV and process it in Excel with little effort.
