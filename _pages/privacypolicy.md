# Privacy Policy

<br>

## Personal Data
I do not collect any of your data. Nothing.

Everything you do is saved on-device.


The app does not display any ads or send anything to any server. So the app does not track you using an advertising identifier or anything of the sort.

## Any Question?
If you have any issues to report or feedback to make about this privacy policy or anything else, you can contact me at golf.logbook@gmail.com.
